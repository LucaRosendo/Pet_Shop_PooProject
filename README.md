# 🐾 Pet Shop Management System – Object-Oriented Programming Project

This project is a **Pet Shop Management System** developed with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The software allows for the registration and management of clients, pets, employees, services, products, and service appointments.

It was implemented using the Java programming language (or replace with your chosen language), with a **console-based interface** (or `JOptionPane`), aiming to **demonstrate and apply core OOP concepts** in a real-world scenario.

## ✅ OOP Concepts Applied

* **Classes and Objects** (with attributes, methods, and constructors)
* **Inheritance** (`Animal` → `Dog`, `Cat`, etc.)
* **Polymorphism** (overridden methods in services and animals)
* **Abstract Classes** (`Service`)
* **Interfaces** (`Payable`)
* **Association** (Clients ↔ Pets, Appointments ↔ Employees)
* **Delegation** (payment logic handled by a separate module)
* **Collections** (Lists for storing and managing data)
* **Exception Handling** (e.g., invalid appointments, out-of-stock products)

## 🧩 Features

* Register clients, pets, and staff members
* Schedule services like grooming, bathing, and veterinary consultations
* Manage and sell pet products
* View service history and appointment reports
* Simulate payment processes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Language: Java 
* IDE: VS Code
* Interface: Console or JOptionPane
